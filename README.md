# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the population focused analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Slide Summaries
### 1 Central Question
Purpose: to define the question we are answering. 
-	“How will population differences impact the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?”
### 2 Citi Bike Main Age Demographic
Purpose: Show current user base (age). We will then verify Des Moines has a similar, if not better user base.
Analysis: Our prime ridership is 18-24 years old, but there is steady use from 25-68 years old.
### 3 Citi Bike Main Gender Demographic
Purpose: Show current user base (gender). Males use Citi Bike 13% more than females. Ideally Des Moines will have a male to female ratio skewed towards males.
### 4 Comparison: Population Age & Gender
Purpose: Compare age and gender ratios between cities.
Analysis: NYC gender ratio skews towards males, while Des Moines skews towards females. This is not ideal, but it will not significantly hurt ridership (43.47% of riders are female).
Both cities have a large 25 to 29 years old population and much smaller 70+ populations. This is good for ridership; many users are 18-68 years old.
### 5 Poverty Level Car Ownership
Purpose: Show if poverty level can predict a higher or lower usage in Des Moines.
Analysis: 20% of people in poverty don’t own cars, so they will be more likely to use Citi Bike. 6.63% of adults don’t own a car, this means ~14,377 adults in Des Moines don’t own a car.
### 6 Comparison: Poverty Level
Analysis: NYC and Des Moines have a similar poverty level of around 19%. We should expect a similar ridership ratio.
### 7 Subscribers vs. Non-subscribers
Purpose: Show that tourists are a significant portion of our customer base. Des Moines should have many tourists if we are to be successful.
### 8 NYC Tourism Vs. Des Moines Tourism
Analysis: Des Moines has a relatively large tourism market, with 13.7 million annual tourists. 2.74 million don’t come with a vehicle and will be prime users.
### 9 Summary
Purpose: Summarize findings
### 10 Growth Opportunity
Purpose: show that Des Moines is not a dying city, it’s been growing since the early 80s.
